# Jim-Skateboard

```
Electric Skateboard is a script in develop who use a base of the script rd_cars.
If you have a supposition of upgrade to add in the script contact me in fiveM forum, my pseudo: 'Super_Chocolatine'.
```

Disclaimer:
```
This is based originally on ElectricSkateboardFiveM but completely rewritten and changed to handle newer fivem features
With the help of `jim_bridge` this also brings more optimization and more features and works on supported frameworks
```

## How to install:
1. Install `jim_bridge` from github and add it before this script in your server load order
2. Place the folder 'jim-skateboard' in your resources folder

4. Add the item to your items.lua:
