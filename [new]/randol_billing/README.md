# Randolio: Billing

**ESX/QB support with bridge**

Society fund function you will have to adjust to your framework needs. I have provided defaults for each framework.

Player commission for billing also optionally supported with a percent cut defined per job in the config.

Recently added closet players to appear in the input dialog aswell as a global player option which will add/remove on job changes. See useGlobal in the config for each job to allow usage of it.

Requirements are ox_lib, ox_target/qb-target.

**Note**: If you get an error for nil value (global GetActivePlayers), make sure your ox lib is up to date and contains the GetActivePlayers() function in the init.lua.
